# Project Description: Prefix-Based Word Completion Tool

## Introduction
The "Prefix-Based Word Completion Tool" project is a Python implementation that assists users in finding words from a given vocabulary that start with a specific prefix. The project comprises four functions and a main function that facilitates user interactions. These functions handle reading and filtering words from a file, creating a dictionary to store completions for each character at various indices, and finding completions for a given prefix.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a useful tool for users to find words with a specific prefix from a given vocabulary. The program prompts the user to input a prefix and then displays all words from the vocabulary that start with that prefix, separated by commas. The functions work in harmony to achieve this functionality, making it easy for users to explore the vocabulary.

## Function Details

### 1. `open_file()`
This function prompts the user to input a vocabulary file name. It keeps prompting the user until a valid file name is entered. It then opens the file with UTF-8 encoding and returns the file pointer `fp`.

### 2. `read_file(fp)`
This function reads the opened file, creating a set of all words in the file. It filters out words with a single character and removes punctuations from words. The function returns the set of all valid words.

### 3. `fill_completions(words)`
This function creates a dictionary that stores a set of words as completions for each character at each index of a word in the set of words. The keys of this dictionary are of the form `(i,ch)` where `i` is the index, and `ch` is the character at that index of the word being addressed. The corresponding values of this dictionary are sets of words that have the character `ch` at index `i`.

### 4. `find_completions(prefix, word_dic)`
This function takes a prefix and a completions dictionary and returns the set of words in the completions dictionary that complete the prefix, if any. If the prefix cannot be completed to any vocabulary words, an empty set is returned.

### 5. `main()`
This is the main function that interacts with the user. It asks the user to enter a prefix and prints all the words containing that prefix, separated by commas. It also prints a "no completions" message if no words with the entered prefix are found. Lastly, it prints the exiting message when the user chooses to quit the program.

## Implementation
The project is implemented in Python and uses standard string processing techniques to filter words, remove punctuations, and create dictionaries. The main function orchestrates the interaction with the user, allowing them to input prefixes and receive relevant word completions. The functions work together efficiently to provide a smooth and accurate experience for the user.

## Suggestions for Improvements
1. **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling to handle unexpected input or issues with file reading.
   
2. **User Interface**: Enhance the user interface by providing clearer instructions and feedback to the user regarding their input and the results obtained.

3. **Efficiency**: Optimize the algorithm to improve efficiency, especially when dealing with a large vocabulary. Potential improvements could involve data structures and algorithms that minimize time complexity.

4. **Code Modularity**: Consider breaking down the `main()` function into smaller, more focused functions for better code modularity and readability.

5. **Comments and Documentation**: Add more detailed comments and documentation throughout the code to enhance understandability and maintainability.
